A small set of products and categories contribute the majority of total revenue, indicating a strong Pareto (80/20) effect. These products should be prioritized for inventory and promotions.

2️⃣ Regional Performance Variation
Certain regions consistently outperform others in sales and profit, while some regions show low sales despite high order volumes, indicating pricing or logistics inefficiencies.

3️⃣ Customer Segment Profitability
Specific customer segments generate higher profit margins even with fewer orders, suggesting targeted marketing toward high-value customers can improve overall profitability.

4️⃣ Seasonal Sales Trends
Sales peak during specific months or seasons, highlighting opportunities for timed promotions and inventory planning.

5️⃣ High Sales, Low Profit Products
Some products show high sales volume but low or negative profit due to heavy discounts or high costs, signaling the need for price optimization.
